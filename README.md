## architecture and fold structure

### logic

business logic with pure functions

### adapters

converts internal data to external and vice-versa

### ports

communicates with external sources (other api, database)

in this example the in memory database is used as an example for this communication

### controllers

uses the logic, adapters and ports to return the desired result to the caller
